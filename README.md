This project focused on predicting interest rates based on information derived from a kaggle data set. The dataset compiles variables related to the economic conditions of the United States.
The date of information ranges from 1954 to 2017. Becuase of this, there was a requirement to extract more recent information from FRED, Federal Reserve Economic Data. 
After cleaning up the data, locating necessary missing data, and formatting the data using R code, the next stage was to perform the predicive analysis. 
In this project, ridge regression model and an autoregression model were both used. 
The results and process are broken down into detail in the report.
